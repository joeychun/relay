# Welcome to the Relay Game!

In **Relay**, teams engage in solving a series of problems that update daily, in a relay-like fashion. Each teammate tackles one problem before passing it to the next; the solution to each problem becomes the starting point for the next one. 

The routineness of the daily challenge and the collaboration required to reach the final answer makes **Relay** a low-stakes, fun way to build community through math for anybody—from casual number enthusiasts to students preparing for Olympiads!

(P.S. Thanks to mathdash.live for inspiring me with ideas about a social math game!)

## Functionality: 
### Lobby page (creating and joining teams):
- If not already in one, users can start a new Relay team.

- Alternatively, users can join another user’s team by entering their team code.

### Recruiting page:
- Unless a team is already full, users can recruit teammates by sharing the team’s unique code.

### Problem page:
- When a full team is made, teammates engage in daily relay problems. Each teammate tackles one problem before passing it to the next; the solution to each problem becomes the starting point for the next one.

### Team page:
- If their team is active (full roster of members), users can check various team stats, including the longest relay streak, latest performance, and recent problems.

- Users can click on one of the recent relay problems in the right table to access the day's questions, the correct answers, and their teams' submitted answers.

## Credits & Technical details: 
Big thanks to my sister for helping me flesh out the backend, as well as MIT’s web.lab for providing me with the typescript skeleton. I used a MERN tech stack.

## Future extensions:
These are some extensions I would love to add later, ranging in various difficulties:

- Email notifications (I’m working on this now!) 
- Have multiple leagues (beginner, medium, hard). 
- Train a GPT model on math competition problem data to write new relay problems
- Have the team be able to pick which order contestants go in
- Have a flexible number of teammates
- Add category data to questions for better statistics, as well as individual statistics
